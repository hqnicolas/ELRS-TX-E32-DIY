### Frequency Steps

1. Please first check the software version number of the latest generation ELRS head or the The integrated ELRS high-frequency head module. Currently, only major version numbers **1.x.x** and **2.x.x** are available. Please confirm that the high-frequency head and receiver are the same major version.
* (If the high-frequency head with software version 2.0.1 and the receiver with software version 2.30 can be used for frequency matching normally, there is no need to update the high-frequency head firmware.)
* However, for better compatibility, it is recommended to update the high-frequency head and receiver to the same software version.

2. If the receiver turns on and off quickly three times, the LED will start flashing twice, indicating that the receiver has entered frequency matching mode. Enter the high-frequency head binding mode.

3. After successful binding, the LED on the receiver will be constantly lit and can also receive telemetry signals.

4. **Receiver LED Status Meaning:**
- **Steady light:** for successful frequency matching or normal communication connection.
- **Double-flashing LED:** for frequency matching.
- **Slow-flashing LED:** unable to receive a signal from the transmitter.
- **Fast-flashing LED:** in Wi-Fi communication mode. At this time, the program can be updated via a computer or mobile phone connection.

![capacityes](img/capacity.webp)

BelinRC ELRS-433-TX, the high-frequency head, can be used with all remote controls on the market that use the JR interface. (Interface Diagram):

**2. Basic Configuration**

By default, the ELRS-433-TX high-frequency head only accepts Crossfire Serial Data Protocol (CRSF) signals. The remote control's main high-frequency interface must support CRSF signal output. The following example uses the OpenTX remote control system to illustrate how to configure the remote control to generate CRSF signals and use the LUA script to control the ELRS high-frequency head.

**3. CRSF Protocol**

In OpenTX, select **MODELSELECTION** to enter the **MODELSETUP** page, where you can turn off the internal RF (**OFF**), enable the external RF (**External RF**), and set the output mode to **CRSF**. This is shown in the figure below.

If the ELRS-433-TX high-frequency head is connected correctly and the remote control is configured to output CRSF from the external high-frequency head (External RF) as described above, the ELRS high-frequency head can generally be used normally.

**4. LUA Script Manipulation**

If you want to modify the power and refresh rate of the ELRS high-frequency head, you need to use the OpenTX system's LUA script. It is shown below.

- Copy the official LUA script `ELRS.lua` to the remote's SD card (the path is `Scripts/tools`).
- In the OpenTX system, press and hold the **SYS** button (e.g., RadioMaster T8 remote, etc.) or the **MENU** button (e.g., Frsky Taranis X9D remote, etc.) to enter the **SD-HC CARD** interface, select the `ELRS.lua` script, and run it.
- If the LUA script executes successfully, the following figure shows the page.
- Using the LUA script, you can choose to configure parameters such as **Rate**, **Ratio**, and **Power**. The following table describes all the features of the LUA script.

## LoRa Review

**LoRa (Long Range)** is a wireless communication technology designed for long-distance, low-power communication between devices. It's particularly well-suited for **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **machine-to-machine (M2M)** applications. LoRa technology is based on half-duplex modulation and ensures reliable connections through spread spectrum and forward error correction coding.

---

<a name="a2"></a>

## How LoRa works

1.  **Signal Encoding**: The transmitting device uses forward error correction to encode data, adding redundant information to improve reliability.
2.  **Spread Spectrum Modulation**: The transmitter spreads the signal over a wider frequency band. This distributes the signal's energy, which boosts its immunity to noise.
3.  **Collision Prevention and Access**: LoRa devices use the **ALOHA protocol** to avoid data collisions on the network.
4.  **Network Server**: This server coordinates communication between gateways, processes incoming data, and forwards it to the appropriate application server or cloud platform. It also handles device registration, authentication, and key management.
5.  **Application Server**: This server receives data from the network server and processes it for the application. The data can then be displayed, saved to a database, or used to trigger other actions.
6.  **Reception and Demodulation**: The receiver listens for the signal at a specific frequency and uses a LoRa modem to demodulate it, restoring the original data.
7.  **Direct Error Correction Decoding**: The receiver decodes the demodulated signal to correct any transmission errors.
8.  **Data Extraction**: The valid data is extracted for processing and use.

## Characteristics of LoRa

1.  **Long-distance transmission**: LoRa's low-power spread-spectrum modulation allows for long-range communication. It can transmit over greater distances than narrowband modulation with the same power.
2.  **Low energy consumption**: LoRa devices can transmit data in short bursts and then enter a sleep mode, which significantly extends battery life. This is vital for battery-powered IoT devices.
3.  **Large capacity**: LoRa can support a large number of devices simultaneously due to its collision avoidance and multi-channel access technology.
4.  **Strong anti-interference**: The technology is robust in harsh environments. It uses spread-spectrum broadband modulation and forward error correction to resist multi-beam fading, noise, and interference.
5.  **Flexibility**: LoRa can operate on different frequency bands and be customized for specific applications and regional regulations. It uses globally available **ISM frequency bands** like 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 433 MHz.
6.  **Long-distance communication**: Devices can exchange data over several kilometers, making it suitable for wide-area applications.
7.  **Low data transfer speeds**: LoRa is typically used for low-data-rate applications, such as transmitting small amounts of sensor data.

# Chip SX1278

<a name="a5"></a>

### 1. What is the SX1278 chip?

The **SX1278** is a remote sensing component for **Internet of Things (IoT)** networks. It enables long-distance data communication between devices and sensors, which is valuable for remote monitoring. The chip uses broadband wireless technology for high-frequency, low-latency data transmission. Manufactured by **Semtech**, the SX1278 chip is the core of LoRa wireless communication, supporting multiple frequency bands (e.g., 868 MHz, 915 MHz) for long-range and low-power operations. It integrates LoRa modems, error correction, and spread-spectrum technology for reliable communication. Its frequency range is 0.3 to 4.5 MHz, with a typical range of about 300 meters or 0.3 kilometers.
